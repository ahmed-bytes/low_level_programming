Welcome to Day 2 of our coding challenge! In this challenge, you'll work with arrays and implement various operations on them. Let's dive in!

## Challenge Description

### Problem Statement

You are required to write a program that performs the following tasks:

1. Reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the size of an array.

2. Reads `n` integers from the user and stores them in an array.

3. Implements a function `int findMax(int arr[], int size)` that takes the array and its size as parameters and returns the maximum value in the array.

4. Implements a function `int findMin(int arr[], int size)` that takes the array and its size as parameters and returns the minimum value in the array.

5. Implements a function `int calculateSum(int arr[], int size)` that takes the array and its size as parameters and returns the sum of all elements in the array.

6. Implements a function `void printArray(int arr[], int size)` that takes the array and its size as parameters and prints all the elements in the array.

### Example

```
Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter 5 integers: 10 25 7 42 15

Maximum value: 42
Minimum value: 7
Sum of all elements: 99
Array elements: 10 25 7 42 15

```
