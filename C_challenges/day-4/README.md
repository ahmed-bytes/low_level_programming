Welcome to Day 4 of our coding challenge! In this challenge, you'll tackle the "Two Sum" problem. Let's get started!

## Challenge Description

### Problem Statement

Write a program that takes the size of an array, an array of integers, and a target value as input and returns the indices of two elements in the array that add up to the target value. If there are no such elements, return an empty array. Assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example

```c
Size: 4
Numbers: 2, 7, 11, 15
Target Value: 9
Indices: 0, 1
```
