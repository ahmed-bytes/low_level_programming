## üöÄ Challenges

Explore a variety of programming challenges that will push your C skills to the next level:

### üî® Basics of C Programming

1. **Factorial Calculation**
   - Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

2. **Reverse a String**
   - Reverse a string without using any library function.

3. **Merge Sort**
   - Sort an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm.

4. **Linked List Operations**
   - Implement a basic singly linked list and perform operations like insertion and deletion.

5. **Binary Search**
   - Implement a binary search algorithm for a sorted array.

### üî• Advanced Challenges

6. **String Concatenation**
   - Concatenate two strings using pointers.

7. **Find the Longest Word**
   - Find the longest word in a sentence using pointers and arrays.

8. **Reverse Word Order**
   - Reverse the order of words in a sentence using pointers and arrays.

### üí° Challenges with Structs

9. **Student Record**
   - Manage student records using a struct with fields for name, roll number, and marks.

10. **String Manipulation**
    - Replace words in a sentence with others using structs to represent word replacements.

11. **Employee Management System**
    - Manage employee records using structs with fields for name, ID, salary, and department.

### üß† Challenges with Function Pointers and Variadic Functions

12. **Dynamic Calculator**
    - Create a dynamic calculator using function pointers and variadic functions to handle different operations and numbers of operands.

13. **To-Do List Manager**
    - Manage a to-do list with a singly linked list, using function pointers to perform actions like adding and removing tasks.

14. **Music Library**
    - Simulate a music library using a singly linked list with function pointers to add, remove, and search for songs.

15. **Personal Finance Tracker**
    - Develop a personal finance tracker with a singly linked list to manage financial transactions. Use function pointers for various financial operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

Each challenge is presented as a source file in the repository. You can find the source code, test cases, and expected outputs within each challenge's source file. To tackle a challenge, you can:

1. Download the source file.
2. Write your C program to solve the challenge.
3. Test your solution with the provided test cases.
