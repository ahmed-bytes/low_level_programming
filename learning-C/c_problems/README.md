## Introduction

C is a powerful and widely used programming language known for its efficiency and low-level control. This repository serves as a record of my progress and accomplishments as I dive deeper into the world of C programming. Through these coding challenges and projects, I aim to sharpen my problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of the language.

## Challenges

In the **Challenges** directory, you will find a series of coding challenges that I have attempted. These challenges are sourced from various platforms, such as *LeetCode*, *HackerRank*, and *Project Euler*, among others. Each challenge is accompanied by a detailed explanation and my solution in C. Feel free to explore and review my implementations.

## Projects

The **Projects** directory contains a collection of larger-scale projects that I have completed using C. These projects span various domains and demonstrate my ability to build practical applications with the language. Each project comes with a detailed README that explains its purpose, features, and instructions on how to run and interact with it.

## Contributing
